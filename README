A generic decision making algorithm that can return the best decision found so far at any point.

The algorithm starts with a starting state that can be iterated on until the best decision has been made or enough time has gone by.

Two test suites are included that show how it can be used to:
 * Perform an A* pathfinding search
 * Arrive at a given number by repeatedly performing multiplication, addition or subtraction of 3 on the starting value
